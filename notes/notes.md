###### Verbatim strings

Verbatim strings that do not use escape characters and preserves new lines are created by putting 'at' sign just before the string.
```csharp
"\x0041BCDE"  \\ Will print "ABCD"
@"\x0041BCDE"  \\ Will print "\x0041BCDE"
@"The quick
brown fox
jumps over the lazy dog"  \\ New lines in verbatim strings are preserved
```


###### float and double literals

By default, every number with decimal fraction is of `double` type, unless we add `f` after the number. So: `3.14` as double, `3.14f` is float.

###### Casting.

```csharp
double d = 1.0;
float f = (float)d;
int i;
i = (int)2.5;
```


###### Loops

There are three looping constructs in C#.

```csharp
do
	// do something here
while (condition);

while (condition)
    // do something here

for (setup; finish; update)
    // do something here
```


###### Every statement returns a value

E.g. `i = (j=0);` sets both `i` and `j` variables to 0.


###### Printing tips and tricks

```csharp
// Using placeholders:
int i = 150;
double f = 1234.56789;
Console.WriteLine("i: {0} f: {1}", i, f);
Console.WriteLine("i: {1} f: {0}", f, i);
// It works similarly to Python's .format used
// before f-strings were a thing.

// Adjusting real number precision:
Console.WriteLine("i: {0:0} f: {1:0.00}", i, f);
/* First number, for example '1' after 'f', has the same role
   as in the first example, so: positioning.
   '0.00' specifies precision, where '0' stands for
   one or more digits.
   Result:
   i: 150 f: 1234.57
*/

// Specifying the number of printed digits:
Console.WriteLine("i: {0:0000} f: {1:00000.00}", i, f);
// Result:
// i: 0150 f: 01234.57

// Really fancy formatting:
Console.WriteLine("i: {0:#,##0} f: {1:##,##0.00}", i, f);
// '#' in the format string means "put a digit here if you have one".
// Looks like notation I know from formatting spreadsheets.
// Result:
// i: 150 f: 1,234.57

// Printing in columns:
Console.WriteLine("i: {0,10:0} f: {1,15:0.00}", i, f);
Console.WriteLine("i: {0,10:0} f: {1,15:0.00}", 0, 0);
/* Result:
   i:        150 f:         1234.57
   i:          0 f:            0.00
   Integer value in printed in a column 10 characters wide, and
   the double is printed in a 15 character wide column.
   Output is right-justified. To make it left-justified,
   width of columns should be negative, like that:*/
Console.WriteLine("i: {0,-10:0} f: {1,-15:0.00}", i, f);
Console.WriteLine("i: {0,-10:0} f: {1,-15:0.00}", 0, 0);
// Result:
// i: 150       f: 1234.57
// i: 0         f: 0.00
```


###### Values and references

Looks like C# by default passes variables by values. That is considerable change in comparison to Python that passes everything as reference, but should not be too different to Go that has values and pointers, should it?

To pass argument by reference instead by value, simply add `ref` before type: `foo(ref int bar);`.


###### in and out parameters

C# supports `in` and `out` parameters. `in` parameters can not be changed by method, and `out` parameters must by changed by method. A dabbled in Ada and D that have similar concepts â€“ not sure about implementation details though. According to MS docs, `in`, `out`, and `ref` may cause problems with method overloading.


###### Contracts

C# allows using design-by-contract, by supporting preconditions (`Contract.Requires`), postconditions (`Contract.Ensures`) and invariants (`Contract.Invariant`). Invariant methods must be marked as such by `[ContractInvariantMethod]` statement just above method declaration.
More info is needed to use contracts properly.
